  Text: "The wrath of Zeus had become unstoppable. Under his command, I was tasked
    with forging a creature both mesmerizing and terrifying: Pandora, who would come
    to be known as \u201Cthe first woman.\u201D There was a spark in her eyes, she
    was beautiful, intelligent, radiant, and insatiably curious. Each god bestowed
    upon her a gift, and as I shaped her, I found myself almost falling in love."
