  Text: 'Bound to the mountain, he suffered for ages. But I, son of Zeus, broke his
    chains. One arrow silenced the eagle. Justice? Perhaps. Mercy? Not quite. Olympus
    demanded balance.

    Zeus believed he was enacting justice through his actions,
    but is it not the very duty of the gods to protect humanity? Was Prometheus not
    the one for whom Gaia gave life to all the Titans? He was merely showing everyone
    what it truly means to be a God, with a capital G, that which Zeus would never
    be able to embody, not even in pretense.'
