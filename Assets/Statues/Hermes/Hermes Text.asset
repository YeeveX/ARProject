  Text: "I never liked that Prometheus. As a lesser god, a second-rate deity, if
    you will, I could hardly afford to voice my opinions about a Titan. But that
    Prometheus would defy the command of his own cousin Zeus and steal the fire nonetheless\u2026
    that, I certainly did not expect.\nUnder cloak of darkness, Prometheus stole
    fire from the forge of Hephaestus. A dangerous gift, a divine flame now in mortal
    hands. He knew the risk, yet still he defied Olympus."
