  Text: "I do not know the name of the one who watches over us humans, but I know
    we have a protector. Ever since light and warmth were taken from us, I sensed
    something was wrong up there on Olympus. Our guardian would never abandon us
    to darkness and cold. \nAnd indeed, one night, the darkness broke. A glow, warm
    and alive, danced in our hands. Fire! With it, we cooked, forged tools, lit our
    homes. Prometheus gave us more than warmth, he gave us hope."
