  Text: "Zeus\u2019s fury was far from spent, Prometheus still had to be punished.\nHe
    would not bow, so we bound him. To stone, to silence, to eternity. Each day,
    the eagle feasted on his flesh. Each night, he healed. He would have learnt obedience
    through agony\u2026 If only that troublemaker Heracles hadn\u2019t ruined the
    plan of the father of the gods."
