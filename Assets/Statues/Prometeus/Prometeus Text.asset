  Text: "Ever since I was born, I knew I was destined to create something extraordinary.
    My name means \u201Cthe one who thinks first,\u201D and I am the titan blessed
    with the greatest intellect and creativity Olympus has ever known. I didn\u2019t
    yet know what awaited me, but one day, I had an idea that would change the course
    of my life forever.\nWith clay from the earth and water from the rivers, I shaped
    mankind in the image of the gods. Fragile, yet full of potential. They needed
    a spark, a beginning. And so, I gave them form, and awaited their awakening."
