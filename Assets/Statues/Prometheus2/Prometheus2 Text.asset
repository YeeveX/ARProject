  Text: "Today, you humans use me as a metaphor for love and devotion. I am one of
    the closest figures you have to a savior. Writers, musicians, poets, painters,
    few have refrained from speaking of my love for humanity, a love for which I
    was punished. Some prefer to use me as a warning: \u201CThose who draw too close
    to the fire will be burned.\u201D But isn\u2019t burning exactly what a soul
    must do to become whole? To burn with passion, with feeling, to burn while revealing
    the deepest truths\u2026\nEven Zeus, in the end, sought to understand my counsel,
    and to this day, the fire burns within each of you, just as it does within me."
