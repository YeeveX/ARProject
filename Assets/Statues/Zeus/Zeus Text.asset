  Text: "I, Zeus, father of all the gods, have always harbored suspicion toward anyone
    who dared come near me. And yet, despite my boundless caution, I was deceived\u2014no
    less, by my very own cousin: Prometheus, one of the most wretched Titans ever
    to walk the earth.\nHe dared to trick me, offering bones dressed in fat while
    hiding the true meat in refuse. I saw through it, of course, yet I accepted the
    false gift. That day, I resolved to withhold fire from humankind. Let them suffer
    his cleverness."
